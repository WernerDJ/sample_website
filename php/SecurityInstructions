The files contact.php and send_email.php should be substituted by 
contact_wrapper.php and send_email_wrapper.php in the php folder
All references to contact.php and send_email.php should be rewritten to 
the wrapper files and the non wrapper files should be written in a folder
out of the web page folders
If linux is being used special permissions might be necessary to be
confered to both files:
sudo chmod 750 (the new path)/send_email.php
sudo chown ubuntu:www-data (the new path)/send_email.php
The email sender wrapper (contact will nearly the same):

<?php
// Include the secure send_email.php script from outside the web directory
require '(the new path)/send_email.php';
?>
