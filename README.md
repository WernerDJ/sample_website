The Blog posts should be written as php files, according to the model Blogpost.php (in the php folder) <br />
For such Blog posts to be loaded as html files where at the end of the post a comment form  and previous comments are displayed it is necessary to upload the files to a server (virtual or real)
Also, a Comments database has to be created to store the comments that are saved by pressig the Submit button at the end of the post or retrieved from it and displayed after the comments form.
